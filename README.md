# Overview:
Developed a Python-based tool to compare images and extract win and bet amounts using OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, and PIL.

# Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, PIL, NumPy, scikit-image
Tools: Regular Expressions (re), OS module for path management
# Key Contributions:

Implemented image comparison using SSIM with OpenCV.
Extracted numerical data from images with Tesseract OCR and regex.
Enhanced image processing with PIL for better OCR accuracy.
Automated image path retrieval and analysis.
